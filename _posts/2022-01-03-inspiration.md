# Inspiration

#### As I started learning iOS development, <u>I needed help</u>. There are thousands of resources across the world that will provide guidance and learning. Some are free, some are not, some teach by video, some teach by example, some just talk through the concepts.

### My only advice to new developers...
## **"Find the way you like to learn and then find a resource that teaches that way."**

### Here are some of my favorite resources:

- <i class="fa-brands fa-swift"></i> **Hacking With Swift:** Paul Hudson [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) runs a phenomenal website and is a treasure trove of information for all levels of iOS developers. I highly recommend starting with his **FREE** courses such as [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) or [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/). I was so inspired by his knowledge and teaching skills that I signed up for his HWS+ subscription. Keep in mind that HWS+ is a paid subscription but, in my very humble opinion, the value is well worth the investment.
- <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> **YouTube:** It may sound silly, but some of the best teaching I have found can be found for free on YouTube. These are the ones that I religiously follow:
  - [Paul Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/@twostraws): Paul puts out tons of videos with great information. He is a patient teacher that explains everything with a touch of humor (and sometimes his dogs <i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i> make an appearance!)
  - [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking): Nick Sarno has a tremendous way of teaching that is very relatable.
  - [Stewart Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/@StewartLynch): Stewart is a master instructor. His videos are well prepared, focused, and everything is clearly explained.
  - [Tundsdev](https://www.youtube.com/@tundsdev): Love these videos! Tunds breaks down the concepts and shows how they apply to real-world applications. A lot of his videos are focused on MVVM architecture and refactoring code so this is great place to start if you are going to move into the professional world where you may be working in a group setting.
  - [Sean Allen](https://www.youtube.com/@seanallen): Sean Allen produces quick and easy lessons for all levels.
  - [Azam Sharp](https://www.youtube.com/@azamsharp): Mohammad Azam provides great videos that don't always follow the main stream thought pattern on design architecture.
  - [Kavsoft](https://www.youtube.com/@Kavsoft): These videos are unique because there is no voice in the video. Everything is shown with comments typed in but they build some of the best and coolest designs I have seen.
  - [CodeSlicing](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeSlicing): Adam's site hasn't been updated in a while, but his information about animation and drawings are phenomenal. Side note on this is many of his video focus on a tool he created to make SwiftUI more accessible and efficient with drawing.
- <i class="fa-brands fa-apple"></i> **Apple:** The obvious and most comprehensive site for iOS development. [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) has done a great job of providing documentation and providing lessons to learn how to develop apps using Swift.
- <i class="fa-solid fa-desktop"></i> **Udemy:** [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) has a ton of courses (not just iOS) from a ton of instructors. Each of these courses are **PAID** content. If you are interested in taking these courses, I highly recommend waiting for a sale. They happen quite regularly and can save a developer large amounts of cash.

## Setup as user homepage

- Go click **fork** on the [github project page](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
- Rename your new repository to `**username**.github.io`. (click settings in the right column)
- Clone your repository, **cd into the project**
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -m master && git push -u origin master && git branch -D gh-pages` to get the *publish* branch as master for a clean, empty starting point.
- On your github project page go to *settings* again and change your **default branch** to ***master***
- Run `git push origin --delete gh-pages` to delete your remote's development branch

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin master`**

-------------------------


## Setup as standalone project page

- Go click **fork** on the [github project page](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
- Rename your new repository to `whatever you want`. (click settings in the right column)
  * It will go live at yourusername.github.io/**WhateverYouWant**
- Clone your repository, cd into the project
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -D gh-pages && git branch -m gh-pages && git push -uf origin gh-pages` to swap the *publish* and *gh-pages* branch.

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**

-------------------------


## Setup inside existing project

This is the most complicated use-case .. but it's the coolest.
Say you've got your kickass project `github.com/t413/kicker` and want to have
some web presence to post about on [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com).
This will create an orphan branch called `gh_pages` in your repository
where you can publish changes, posts, images, and such. It won't alter your code at all.

- `cd` into your project on the command line
- use `git remote add -t publish singlepage git@github.com:t413/SinglePaged.git` to get access to this repository.
- use `git fetch singlepage publish:gh-pages` to fetch the remote branch
- use `git branch --set-upstream gh-pages singlepage/publish && git checkout gh-pages;`
  This creates and checks out an orphan branch called gh-pages that tracks the original and lets you make changes.
- When you run `git push gh-pages:origin/gh-pages` it'll be live at *yourusername.github.io/repositoryName*

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**
